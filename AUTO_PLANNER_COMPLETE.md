# ✅ Auto-Planner Implementation Complete!

The AI planning system now **automatically generates and saves workouts** when you load the app!

## 🎉 What Was Added

### 1. **Auto-Planner Hook** (`src/hooks/useAutoPlanner.ts`)
Smart background service that:
- ✅ Detects gaps in your schedule (next 7 days)
- ✅ Automatically generates plans when 3+ days are missing
- ✅ Saves workouts directly to the database
- ✅ Runs on app load and every hour
- ✅ Considers events, history, and your profile

### 2. **Service Component** (`src/components/AutoPlannerService.tsx`)
UI integration that:
- ✅ Shows friendly notification when workouts are generated
- ✅ Runs silently in the background
- ✅ Displays: "🤖 AI Planner Active - Auto-generated X workouts!"
- ✅ Auto-hides after 10 seconds

### 3. **App Integration** (`src/App.tsx`)
Activated automatically:
- ✅ Runs when user logs in
- ✅ No manual interaction needed
- ✅ Works for all authenticated users

### 4. **Smooth Animations** (`src/index.css`)
Beautiful slide-in notification:
- ✅ Slides from right
- ✅ Fades in smoothly
- ✅ Professional appearance

## 🚀 How It Works

### When You Log In:
1. **Auto-planner checks** your schedule (next 7 days)
2. **Detects gaps** (missing workouts)
3. **Generates plan** using AI (same as manual tool)
4. **Saves to database** automatically
5. **Shows notification** confirming success

### Periodic Checks:
- Runs every **1 hour** automatically
- Fills new gaps as they appear
- No user interaction needed!

## 📊 What Gets Generated

For each day with a gap:
- **Workout record** with action, focus, tags
- **All exercises** with sets, reps, rest, RIR, cues
- **Metadata** marking it as auto-generated
- **Smart scheduling** based on your profile

## ✨ Smart Features

### 1. Gap Detection
```
Your Schedule (7 days ahead):
Day 1: ✅ Workout exists
Day 2: ❌ Missing
Day 3: ❌ Missing
Day 4: ❌ Missing
Day 5: ✅ Workout exists
Day 6: ❌ Missing
Day 7: ❌ Missing

Result: 5 gaps detected → Auto-generate plan!
```

### 2. Duplicate Prevention
- ✅ Always checks before creating
- ✅ Won't overwrite existing workouts
- ✅ Safe to run multiple times

### 3. Event Awareness
- ✅ Fetches your calendar events
- ✅ Tapers around runs/games
- ✅ Respects event days

### 4. History Consideration
- ✅ Reviews last 7 days
- ✅ Considers recent training
- ✅ Adapts to your patterns

## 🎯 Real-World Example

**Scenario**: New user logs in on Monday

```
Before Auto-Planner:
Mon: (empty)
Tue: (empty)
Wed: (empty)
Thu: (empty)
Fri: (empty)
Sat: (empty)
Sun: (empty)

After Auto-Planner (3 seconds later):
Mon: 💪 Upper Body - 4 exercises
Tue: 🏃 Conditioning - 3 exercises
Wed: 🦵 Lower Body - 4 exercises
Thu: 🧘 Recovery/Mobility - 4 exercises
Fri: 💪 Upper Body - 4 exercises
Sat: 😴 Rest
Sun: 🦵 Lower Body - 4 exercises

Notification: "🤖 Auto-generated 5 workouts for your upcoming week!"
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Located in `src/components/AutoPlannerService.tsx`:

```typescript
useAutoPlanner({
  enabled: true,        // Turn on/off
  horizonDays: 7,      // How far ahead to plan
  minGapDays: 3,       // Trigger threshold
  checkIntervalMs: 3600000, // Check frequency (1 hour)
});
```

### Customize for Your Needs:

**More frequent planning:**
```typescript
horizonDays: 14,      // Plan 2 weeks ahead
minGapDays: 2,        // More aggressive
checkIntervalMs: 1800000, // Check every 30 minutes
```

**Less frequent planning:**
```typescript
horizonDays: 5,       // Only 5 days ahead
minGapDays: 5,        // Less aggressive
checkIntervalMs: 86400000, // Once per day
```
