## Database Schema Used

### Tables
- **workouts**: Main workout records
  - `date`: YYYY-MM-DD format
  - `focus`: Workout type/focus area
  - `state`: 'planned' | 'in_progress' | 'completed'
  - `action`: 'workout' | 'recovery' | 'rest'
  - `tags`: String array of tags
  - `plan_meta`: JSON metadata from AI
  
- **exercise**: Linked exercises
  - `workout_id`: Foreign key to workouts
  - `name`: Exercise name
  - `sets`, `reps`: Volume parameters
  - `load_kg`: Weight
  - `rest_sec`: Rest time
  - `rir`: Reps in reserve
  - `done`: Completion status
  - `order_index`: Exercise order
  
- **user_events**: User's schedule events
  - Used by AI to plan around activities
  
- **user_info**: User profile
  - Used by AI for personalization

### Context Functions Used
```typescript
// WorkoutContext
- workouts: Workout[] - All user workouts
- createWorkout(data) - Schedule new workout
- deleteWorkout(id) - Remove workout

// ExerciseContext
- getExercisesByWorkout(workoutId) - Load exercises

// UserInfoContext
- userInfo - User profile for AI
```

## AI Integration

### Generation Process
1. User clicks "Generate with AI"
2. System builds planning context:
   - Recent 14 workouts for history
   - User events from database
   - User profile (goals, equipment, preferences)
3. Calls `planAndCompile()` with context
4. AI generates 1-day personalized workout
5. Creates workout in database with exercises
6. Shows success message

### Context Structure
```typescript
{
  today: "2025-10-01",
  horizon_days: 1,
  profile: {
    goal: "muscle gain",
    frequency_per_week: 4,
    accessible_equipment: "full gym",
    dislikes: "burpees",
    session_length_min: 60
  },
  recent_history: [...], // Last 14 workouts
  events: [...] // User's schedule
}
```

## Statistics Calculation

### Monthly Workouts
- Count all workouts in current month
- Filters by month start/end dates

### Completed Count
- Count workouts with `state === 'completed'`
- Within current month

### Streak
- Start from today, go backward
- Count consecutive days with completed workouts
- Break on gap > 1 day

### Completion Rate
- Formula: (completed / total) × 100
- Rounds to nearest percent

## UI/UX Design

### Color Scheme
- **Primary**: Gray-900 (black)
- **Completed**: Green-100/800
- **In Progress**: Blue-100/800
- **Planned**: Gray-100/600
- **Today**: Blue-50/200
- **Selected**: Ring-2 Ring-Gray-900

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Sidebar offset on desktop (lg:ml-64)
- Modal centering with sidebar offset
- Grid adapts to screen size

### Interactions
- Hover states on all clickable elements
- Smooth transitions (300ms)
- Loading spinners for async operations
- Disabled states during AI generation
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## Key Components

### Calendar Grid (42 days)
```tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-7 gap-px">
  {days.map((date) => (
    <CalendarDay 
      date={date}
      workout={getWorkoutForDate(date)}
      selected={isSelected(date)}
      today={isToday(date)}
    />
  ))}
</div>
```

### Schedule Modal
```tsx
<Modal>
  <AIGenerateButton />
  <Divider />
  <QuickTemplates />
</Modal>
```

### Workout Detail Modal
```tsx
<Modal>
  <WorkoutHeader />
  <ExerciseList />
  <ActionButtons />
</Modal>
```

## Technical Details

### State Management
```typescript
const [currentMonth, setCurrentMonth] = useState<Date>();
const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState<Date>();
const [showScheduleModal, setShowScheduleModal] = useState<boolean>();
const [showWorkoutDetailModal, setShowWorkoutDetailModal] = useState<boolean>();
const [selectedWorkout, setSelectedWorkout] = useState<Workout | null>();
const [isGenerating, setIsGenerating] = useState<boolean>();
```
