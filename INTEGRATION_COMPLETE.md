## 🔑 Enable AI Features (Optional)

Right now, you're using the **deterministic fallback planner** (Mon/Wed/Fri pattern).

To enable **AI-powered intelligent planning**:

### Step 1: Get OpenAI API Key
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign up or log in
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-...`)

### Step 2: Add to .env
```env
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here
```

### Step 3: Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop
npm start
```

### Step 4: Refresh & Test
1. Reload the app
2. Go to AI Planner page
3. You should now see: **"✅ Connected (AI-powered planning)"**
4. Generate a new plan - it will be much smarter!

**Cost**: ~$0.01-0.05 per 7-day plan with GPT-4o-mini (very cheap!)

## ✨ Test Different Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Update Your Profile
1. Click **"👤 Profile"** in sidebar
2. Set your:
   - **Goal**: "strength and hypertrophy"
   - **Frequency**: 4 days/week
   - **Equipment**: "full gym"
   - **Session Length**: 60 minutes
3. Save changes
4. Go back to **AI Planner**
5. Generate new plan
6. Notice how exercises match your settings!

### Scenario 2: Test Bodyweight Only
1. Profile → Set **Equipment** to "bodyweight"
2. AI Planner → Generate plan
3. Notice: Only push-ups, squats, planks, pull-ups (no equipment)

### Scenario 3: Shorter Workouts
1. Profile → Set **Session Length** to 30 minutes
2. AI Planner → Generate plan
3. Notice: Fewer exercises per day (3-4 instead of 5-6)

## 📝 Logging Features

The demo page logs **everything**:

### Planning Process
- ✅ OpenAI connection status
- 📋 User profile details
- 🧠 Plan generation start/completion
- ⏱️ Performance timing (how long it took)

### Plan Details
- 📊 Number of days generated
- 🏋️ Each day's action, focus, and exercise count
- 📈 Summary statistics

### Error Handling
- ❌ Clear error messages if something fails
- 🔧 Helpful troubleshooting tips

### Browser Console
All logs are also in the **browser console** (F12 → Console tab):
```javascript
[AI Planner] 🚀 Starting AI planning process...
[AI Planner] OpenAI Available: ✅ Yes
[AI Planner] 📋 Building planning context...
// ... etc
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### ✅ Immediate (Test Everything)
1. Access `/ai-planner` page ✅
2. Generate a 7-day plan ✅
3. Verify logs show up ✅
4. Check exercises make sense ✅

### 🔜 Short Term (This Week)
1. **Add OpenAI API key** for intelligent planning
2. **Test with different profiles** (equipment, frequency)
3. **Review plan quality** - does it make sense?

### 🚀 Medium Term (Next Week)
1. **Integrate with Database**
   - Save generated plans to Supabase
   - See `src/ai/example-usage.ts` for code examples
   
2. **Add Event Support**
   - Fetch user events from database
   - Plans will taper around events (e.g., Park Run)
   
3. **Add History Integration**
   - Fetch recent workout history
   - Plans consider recent fatigue/soreness

### 🎨 Long Term (Future Enhancements)
1. **Auto-generate plans** from Dashboard
2. **Edit generated plans** before saving
3. **A/B test** AI vs deterministic plans
4. **Progressive overload** tracking
5. **Injury/limitation** handling

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No user logged in"
- You must log in first
- Create an account if needed

### "User info not loaded"
- Go to Profile page
- Fill in your information
- Save changes

### Plan looks random
- Without API key = deterministic (Mon/Wed/Fri)
- With API key = intelligent AI planning

### Exercises don't match equipment
- Update your profile
- Save changes
- Generate new plan

### Nothing happens when clicking button
- Open browser console (F12)
- Look for error messages
- Share errors for debugging
