# Vercel Deployment Setup

## 🚀 Quick Start

Your app is now ready to deploy to Vercel with full AI feedback functionality!

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Vercel serverless function for OpenAI proxy"
git push
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel
- Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
- Click "Import Project"
- Select your GitHub repository
- Vercel will auto-detect it's a React app

### 3. Add Environment Variable
**CRITICAL:** Add your OpenAI API key to Vercel:

1. Go to your project in Vercel Dashboard
2. Click **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
3. Add:
   - **Name**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `sk-your-actual-openai-key`
   - **Environment**: Select all (Production, Preview, Development)
4. Click **Save**

### 4. Redeploy
- Go to **Deployments** tab
- Click the 3 dots on latest deployment
- Click **Redeploy**

## ✅ What You Get

### In Production (Vercel):
- ✅ Full AI feedback analysis system
- ✅ Progressive overload based on RIR
- ✅ Exercise adaptation based on difficulty
- ✅ No CORS issues
- ✅ Secure API key (server-side only)

### In Development (localhost):
- ✅ Core features work (overlays, rest days, weight tracking)
- ✅ Exercise specificity improvements
- ⚠️ Feedback analysis disabled (to avoid CORS)
- 💡 Use CORS browser extension if you want to test feedback locally

## 🌐 Your API Endpoint

After deployment, your serverless function will be available at:
```
https://your-app-name.vercel.app/api/openai
```

## 🔍 Testing in Production

1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Open your production URL
3. Generate a workout plan
4. Check browser console - you should see:
   ```
   [OpenAI Client] Initialized in PRODUCTION mode
   [Orchestrator] Running feedback analysis pipeline...
   ```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI API key not configured" in production
- Make sure you added `OPENAI_API_KEY` to Vercel environment variables
- Redeploy after adding the key

### Feedback analysis not working
- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure you completed at least one workout with feedback
- Environment variable must be exactly `OPENAI_API_KEY` (not `REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY`)

### CORS issues on localhost
- Install "Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin" Chrome extension
- Or keep feedback analysis disabled on localhost (current setup)

## 📊 Features Enabled

✅ **Fixed Issues:**
1. Overlays cover entire screen (no sidebar gap)
2. Rest days respect frequency (3x/week = 4 rest days)
3. Weight tracking at workout completion
4. Specific exercise descriptions (no vague instructions)

✅ **Advanced Features (Production Only):**
5. AI feedback analysis
6. Progressive overload based on RIR
7. Exercise adaptation based on difficulty
8. Intelligent workout progression

## 💰 Cost

- **Vercel**: Free tier includes 100GB-Hrs/month of serverless functions
- **OpenAI**: Pay per API call (typically $0.01-0.05 per workout plan)

## 🔐 Security

✅ API key stored securely in Vercel (not exposed to browser)  
✅ Serverless function validates requests  
✅ CORS headers properly configured  

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
3. Test the full feedback system in production
4. Enjoy intelligent, adaptive workout planning! 💪
