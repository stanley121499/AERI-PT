## Database Integration

### Tables Used
- **workouts**: Main workout records
  - `state`: 'planned' | 'in_progress' | 'completed'
  - `date`: Date of the workout
  - `focus`: Workout name/focus area
  
- **exercise**: Individual exercises
  - `name`: Exercise name
  - `sets`, `reps`: Target volume
  - `rest_sec`: Rest time in seconds
  - `load_kg`: Weight/load
  - `rir`: Reps in reserve
  - `done`: Boolean completion status
  - `order_index`: Exercise order
  - `weight_note`: Instructions/notes
  - `estimated_duration`: Time estimate

### Context Functions Used
```typescript
// WorkoutContext
- workouts: Workout[] - List of all workouts
- updateWorkout(id, updates) - Update workout state

// ExerciseContext
- getExercisesByWorkout(workoutId) - Load exercises
- updateExercise(id, updates) - Mark exercise as done
```

## Technical Details

### State Management
- Uses React useState and useEffect hooks
- Real-time updates through context subscriptions
- Local state for UI interactions (timers, modals)
- Optimistic updates with database synchronization

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Adapts to sidebar on desktop (lg:ml-64)
- Touch-friendly interactive elements
- Large tap targets for checkboxes and buttons

### Performance
- Efficient re-renders using React best practices
- Loads only necessary data
- Smooth animations with CSS transitions
- Timer runs on separate interval

## UI/UX Design Principles

1. **Clarity**: Clear visual hierarchy and exercise information
2. **Feedback**: Immediate visual response to user actions
3. **Progress**: Constant awareness of workout progress
4. **Motivation**: Celebration on completion
5. **Flexibility**: Can skip exercises, extend rest, etc.
6. **Safety**: Confirmation before ending workout
7. **Efficiency**: Auto-progression and smart defaults

## Styling
- Follows existing brand identity (gray-900 primary color)
- Consistent with other pages (Sidebar, headers)
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Accessible color contrasts

## Future Enhancement Ideas

1. **Set-by-set tracking**: Track each individual set with weight/reps
2. **Exercise videos**: Embedded tutorial videos
3. **Voice feedback**: Audio cues for rest timer
4. **History comparison**: Show last workout's performance
5. **Quick notes**: Add notes during workout
6. **Workout sharing**: Share completed workouts
7. **Music integration**: Control music without leaving app
8. **Offline mode**: Work without internet connection
9. **Apple Watch integration**: Control from watch
10. **Social features**: Share achievements
