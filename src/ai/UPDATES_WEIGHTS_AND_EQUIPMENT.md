# 🔧 Updates: Weight Recommendations & Equipment Filtering

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Added Weight Recommendations
All dumbbell exercises now include starting weight recommendations:

**Upper Body Weights:**
- Dumbbell Bench Press: 20kg (per hand)
- Dumbbell Row: 22kg
- Dumbbell Shoulder Press: 15kg
- Dumbbell Lateral Raise: 8kg

**Lower Body Weights:**
- Dumbbell Goblet Squat: 20kg
- Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift: 25kg
- Dumbbell Bulgarian Split Squat: 15kg (per hand)
- Dumbbell Calf Raise: 20kg (per hand)

**Full Body Weights:**
- Dumbbell Goblet Squat: 16kg
- Dumbbell Row: 18kg
- Dumbbell Overhead Press: 12kg

**Conditioning Weights:**
- Dumbbell Thrusters: 10kg
- Dumbbell Swings: 12kg

### 2. ✅ Improved Equipment Filtering

The system now properly parses your equipment string and **only** shows exercises you can actually do.

**How It Works:**
- **Before**: "Assisted Pull-ups" would appear even without a pull-up bar
- **After**: Only shows exercises using equipment you specified

**Equipment Detection:**
The system intelligently parses your equipment string:

```
"Dumbbells up to 50kg, yoga mat"
  → Detected: dumbbells, mat, bodyweight
  → Will show: All dumbbell exercises, bodyweight exercises, mat-based exercises
  → Will NOT show: Pull-ups, barbell exercises, machine exercises
```

**Smart Parsing:**
- Detects: dumbbells, kettlebells, barbells, pull-up bars, benches, mats, bands, machines
- Case-insensitive
- Handles variations: "dumbbell" = "dumbbells"
- Special case: "full gym" = all equipment

### 3. ✅ Updated Exercise Templates

**Replaced equipment-heavy exercises with dumbbell versions:**
- ❌ Barbell Bench Press → ✅ Dumbbell Bench Press
- ❌ Barbell Row → ✅ Dumbbell Row  
- ❌ Barbell Back Squat → ✅ Dumbbell Goblet Squat
- ❌ Pull-ups → ✅ Removed from default templates
- ❌ Assault Bike → ✅ Bodyweight alternatives

**All exercises now prioritize:**
1. Dumbbells (most common home equipment)
2. Bodyweight (always available)
3. Minimal equipment needs

### 4. ✅ Added Console Logging

Equipment filtering now logs everything:

```javascript
[Compiler] User equipment: dumbbells, mat, bodyweight
[Compiler] Filtered out "Pull-ups" - missing equipment: pull-up bar
[Compiler] Filtered out "Barbell Row" - missing equipment: barbell
```

## Example Results

### Before:
```
Equipment: "Dumbbells up to 50kg, yoga mat"

Generated Exercises:
1. Barbell Bench Press - ❌ No barbell!
2. Pull-ups - ❌ No pull-up bar!
3. Assisted Pull-ups - ❌ No pull-up bar!
4. Leg Curl Machine - ❌ No machine!
```

### After:
```
Equipment: "Dumbbells up to 50kg, yoga mat"

Generated Exercises:
1. Dumbbell Bench Press - 20kg ✅
2. Dumbbell Row - 22kg ✅
3. Dumbbell Shoulder Press - 15kg ✅
4. Push-ups ✅
```

## Weight Guidelines

The included weights are **starting suggestions** and will show in your workout cards:

```
Exercise: Dumbbell Bench Press - 20kg
Sets: 4 × 8 reps
Rest: 180s
RIR: 2
```

**Note**: These are moderate starting weights suitable for most intermediate lifters. Users should:
- ✅ Adjust based on their strength level
- ✅ Progress over time
- ✅ Use the RIR (Reps in Reserve) to guide intensity

## Equipment String Examples

**Minimal Setup:**
```
"Dumbbells, yoga mat"
→ Dumbbell exercises + bodyweight + mat-based
```

**Home Gym:**
```
"Dumbbells, kettlebells, pull-up bar, bench"
→ Dumbbell + kettlebell + pull-up + bench exercises
```

**Full Gym:**
```
"Full gym"
→ All exercises available (barbell, machines, cables, etc.)
```

**Bodyweight Only:**
```
"Bodyweight" or "" (empty)
→ Push-ups, squats, planks, lunges, etc.
```

## Testing

### Test 1: Dumbbells Only
```typescript
profile: {
  accessible_equipment: "Dumbbells up to 50kg"
}

Expected: Only dumbbell and bodyweight exercises
Result: ✅ No pull-ups, no barbells, no machines
```

### Test 2: Full Gym
```typescript
profile: {
  accessible_equipment: "Full gym"
}

Expected: All exercises available
Result: ✅ Includes barbell, pull-ups, machines
```

### Test 3: Empty/Null
```typescript
profile: {
  accessible_equipment: null
}

Expected: Bodyweight only
Result: ✅ Push-ups, squats, planks
```

## Console Verification

When generating a plan, check the console:

```javascript
[Compiler] User equipment: dumbbells, mat, bodyweight
[Compiler] Filtered out "Pull-ups" - missing equipment: pull-up bar
[Compiler] Filtered out "Barbell Row" - missing equipment: barbell
```

This confirms the filtering is working correctly!
